Helps game designers and artists create maps without any coding.
- Block creation, selection, and management (Game Design)
- 3D grid system
- Spawn point management (Game Design)
- Tile-based base and top decoration (Art)
- Prop generation (Art)

### Cards Generator
  
The Cards Generator creates card assets (ScriptableObjects) from a CSV file exported from Notion.
This tool acts as a bridge between the Game Design Document (GDD) and the Unity project, saving us significant development time.
