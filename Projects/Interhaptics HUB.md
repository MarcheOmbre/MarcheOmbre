![Interhaptics HUB](../Media/HapticDemonstrator.png)

Interhaptics HUB is a technical demo showing the capabilities of the Interaction Builder and the Haptic composer.
The demo is composed of four scenes :
- Introduction: Teaches in a gamified way how to interact with the surrounding objects. It also brings different objects to play with (bow, ballista, radioâ€¦). 
- Remote car: Allows you to drive a radio-controlled car. The objective is to use the car to destroy a maximum of blocks. 
- Breakfast: Demonstrates how to squeeze your morning orange juice with the help of a mechanical arm (10 meters high). 
- Haptic scene: Highlights the capabilities of haptics (vibrations, textures and stiffness).
